# Subdominant
A wrapper around famous web security tools to automate the recon process.

After getting the root domains of a target, put them all into a file named 'rootdomains', and then fire up the script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TSlayman/Subdominant /opt/Subdominant
cd /opt/Subdominant
bash install.sh
chmod +x subdominant
./subdominant 
```
